        <p>There are different types of video editing. Here are some of the major types of editing.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Film Splicing - This is one of the oldest forms of editing. "Traditionally, film is edited by cutting sections of the film and rearranging or discarding them. The process is very straightforward and mechanical."</p>

              <li>
                <p>Tape to Tape (Linear) - This is the "original method of editing electronic video tapes before editing computers became available in the 1990s." Today this is not the desired method but in some situations it is still used.</li></p>

              <li>
                <p>Digital/Computer (Non-Linear) - This is the most modern way of editing today. In this method, footage is recorded through a video camera and then the footage is transferred to a hard drive where the editor then grabs that footage and imports it into an editing software and begins the editing process.</li></p>
           </ul>

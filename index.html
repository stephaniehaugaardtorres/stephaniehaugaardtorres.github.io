        <h3>Film Interest</h3>
        <br>
        <p>From an early age Stephanie has been interested in films and how they are made.
          In middle school, she became interested in the behind the scenes and 
          would watch the Director's commentary on DVDs and then go searching for more
          information on YouTube to learn more about how a certain film was made. During her 
          sophomore year in college, her passion for film became deeper and she decided to pursue
          her Master's degree in film and tv in the spring of 2019. Since then, she has been gearing
          her interest towards film editing by editing her own projects and sharing her skills with some 
          non-profit organizations. After graduation, she looks forward to contributing her skills to the 
          entertainment industry and creating stories that will leave a lasting impact in the audience.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3> Developer Interest</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Since the age of 5 Stephanie always wanted to be a software engineer like her father.
          She became interested in robotics at the age of 10. Her interest in robotics began when she saw 
          what Lego Mindstorms could do. In middle school she took a robotics class which expanded her interest 
          in the field. However, she then diviated from that interest and focused more on her passion for the 
          arts until January 2022 when she realized that becoming a developer could align with her passion for 
          film. In July 2022, Stephanie earned her Responsive Web Design certificate from FreeCodeCamp motivating
          her to continue her developer journey to earning her JavaScript certificate. Practicing and learning to 
          code has deepened her interest in the developer field and hopes to one day be able to share her film passion
          and coding interest with others.
